# Earthquake

Arduino-based earthquake alarm system designed to continuously monitor the surrounding environment to detect earthquakes and give you enough time to safety.
The earthquake monitoring sensitivity can be increased or lowered with the use of two buttons and has an LCD Screen to display the sensitivity number, status and alarm type. 

It was originally designed as dangerous structure monitoring system for a group of firefighters, more on the readme files.

History:
My name is Martín Z, I have been prototyping and building devices based on the Arduino for almost ten years. I became a known as maker on my community and was asked to meet with an important Firefighter group of the country where I live, Ecuador. I learned quickly that the most dangerous part of being a firefighting rescuer was to get through dangerous structures, learned that quickly from the visible scars of the firefighter’s chief, he then told me he spent six months in a coma from a structure collapsing and the ceiling falling onto him. They then told me that the device that they were using took about twenty minutes to set up and cost tens of thousands of dollars to get. They asked to make a device they could use and get feedback from the structure’s degree of movement, so I did and also donated it to firefighters of different cities.
