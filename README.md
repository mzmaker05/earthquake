Histroy:
My name is Mart√≠n Zivadinovic, I have been prototyping and building devices based on the Arduino for almost ten years from the time it was created. I dont have a formal background on IT but I took a class in University where I learned how to code in PHP, from there I started programing websites and about the same time I learned about the Arduino and built many devices trough out the years, five years later I started building and flying drones, I became a know maker on my community and was scheduled with the most important Firefighter group of the country where I live, Ecuador
